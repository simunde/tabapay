# Payment Processing SDK and Sample App

## Introduction

The Payment Processing SDK simplifies the integration of payment transactions into Android applications. This repository includes the SDK and a sample app that demonstrates its capabilities using mock data for simulating payment transactions.


## Features

- **Transaction Processing**: Simulate payment transactions with success, failure, and processing states.
- **Payment Methods Management**: Add, remove, and list payment methods (credit and debit cards) using mock data.
- **Transaction History**: Retrieve a user's transaction history.
